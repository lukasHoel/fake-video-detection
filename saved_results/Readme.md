Contains all saved models for the specific runs found in `runs` directory.

### Naming conventions:

- <b>Baseline (trained by Lukas):</b> `baseline_<id>.pt`
- <b>TemporalEncoderII (trained by Lukas):</b> `temporal_encoder_2_<id>.pt`
- <b>Optical Flow (trained by Anna):</b> `optical_flow_model<id>.pt`

Each model has a unique identifier as suffix. That identifier is the same that is used in the `runs` directory.

<b> See the `runs` directory for an overview of which runs we made, which runs are mentioned in our report and general information.</b>

We did not upload the pretrained models from our results into this git repository. Instead access them through our cloud storage: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1m_XR1HWRMkXv-pS2bUxo3hEHsMeJ3fxN?usp=sharing
