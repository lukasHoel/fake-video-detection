Usage of image extraction:
    python extract_compressed_videos.py --data_path path/to/FaceForensics/ --dataset {FaceSwap, Deepfakes, Face2Face} --compression {c0, c23, c40}
    
    This will extract images of the specified dataset in the specified compression.
    For 30 examples in the c40 compression, this will create ~10GB of images per dataset.
    
    This program requires opencv installation, e.g. with conda install opencv
    
Usage of downsampling:
    ./downsample.sh <base-path> e.g. ./downsample.sh manipulated_sequences/Deepfakes/c40/images/
    
    base-path shall be the directory in which the different videos/images lie, e.g.
        FaceForensics\manipulated_sequences\Deepfakes\c40\images
            033_097
            123_456
            234_567
            345_678
            
    It will create a subdirectory "downsampled" in every subdirectory, e.g. in 033_097/downsampled
    Into that directory every image of e.g. 033_097 will be downsampled with height of 120 and corresponding width that keeps the aspect ratio
    e.g. the file 037_097/0000.png is later found in downsampled/0000_-1:120.png
    
    This program requires ffmpeg installation, e.g. sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
